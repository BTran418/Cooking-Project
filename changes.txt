High:
- What happens when you have hundreds of tags?
- Think about styling the comments as well (user name styled differently than the text in the comment)
- Text like “Search by” is tough to read (dark on dark)
- Your search results are “Below the fold” – there’s no indication that any searching was done. Try and make it more clear that there are results (or not) with the search.
- Make it clear visually which ingredients have substitutes.
- Comment box way too wide
- Show a message when no results are found when searching. Let the user know what is going on.
- Show the changes made on the ingredients recipe list.

Medium:
- Restyle the stuff that has hyperlink underlines. (Ex: Recipe of the week.)
- Put some padding into the search bar (it’s crammed against the “Text” and “Tags” buttons). Also – think about placement of the tags box and search button.
- Think about what happens when you have hundreds of recipes in here.
- Maybe show/hide the ingredients/skills/equipment? I probably don’t need it once I’m ready to go.
- Tags could be implemented into part of the search…comes up as typed
- Make it more obvious that “Text ” and “Tags” are clickable
- Your heading says “Videos” when I think it should be “Recipes”

Low:
- Show some actual comments in the comments section.
- The video gets super big for me. Ends up covering the instructions. [note: Videos breaks on Chrome. Will fix if there is time.]
- Make the text in the instructions more structured – try and make it easier to step through what each instruction is asking for. Ex: Bullet points at minimum.
- Have only the actual ingredients in the list scroll (and not the header.. it gets lost and then I get lost)
- Maintain consistency throughout page…. comment page looks out of place, colours are too different
- Move Add comment button to underneath the text box
- Make use of icons to reduce the amount of text.
- Button to show a random recipe.
- “Tags” appears in the menu – I feel like this should probably be “categories” and should show up differently somehow. (A submenu maybe?)
- Nutrition values for the recipes.
